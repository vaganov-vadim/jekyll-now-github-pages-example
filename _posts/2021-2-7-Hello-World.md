title: Hello World!
---

Hello everyone! I've decided to create my blog for the sake of self-improvement. Many brilliant developers say that creating a blog is _the best_ thing you can do for your career. So I will give it a shot!
I will mostly post about **.NET** development and other software development-related things.

Let me tease you a little. Next few weeks I will post about a surprisingly hot topic in my team - **tuples in C#**. 
Tuples are not a new feature by any means but some people are still not sure how to use them properly.
In the next few posts I'll discuss:
- what's the main use-case for tuples;
- compare them with anonymous types;
- dig into some interesting details you might not know;
- also take a look into the functional world and borrow tuple usages and techniques from **F#**. 

I am going to post at least on the _weekly basis_ so stay tuned!
